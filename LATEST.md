- Added the Jukebox Folder setting (Default `.../BloonsTD6/Jukebox`) wherein any .mp3 or .wav files will be automatically
  loaded into the BTD6 Jukebox
    - Can add new tracks from files without restarting the game, but can't delete them
- Added the Hide Friend Scores option (Default Off) that lets you Hide the indicators on the Map Select Screen of the
  highest round completed amongst you and your friends
- Added the Quick Sell option (Default On) that makes it so that if you hold down the Sell Tower hotkey, you will sell
  towers as you select them
- Dartling / Mortar / Paragon Sentry targeting and Bloon Trap Auto Retarget have moved to a separate
  mod [Tactical Tweaks](https://github.com/doombubbles/tactical-tweaks) for changes that directly alter gameplay and
  aren't just pure Quality of Life utilities
