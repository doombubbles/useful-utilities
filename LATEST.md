## Upgrade Queueing
- Allows you to queue upgrades to be automatically purchased later once you have the cash.
  - Default mode is 'Shift', which means holding the Shift key while trying to upgrade a tower will queue the upgrade.
  - Or, the 'Any' mode makes any upgrade attempt queue the upgrade if you don't have the cash for it.
  - Or it can be turned 'Off' entirely
- A list of currently queued upgrades is visible in the top left by the Cash display
  - Additionally, in the tower selection menu, the upgrade pips will be labeled with their position in queue
  - Clicking on the visual indicators in either place will cancel that queued upgrade
- If you try to Paste a tower when you don't have enough money, you'll now be able to place the base tower and have the upgrades be queued
