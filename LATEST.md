- Added a new "Un-FastForward on Danger" utility (default off)
  - Automatically turns off Fast Forward mode if a dangerous enough non-boss Bloon (default >25% of your lives) makes it past a certain point along a track (default 95%)
- Added a new "Map Events Pause Auto Start" utility (default on)
  - Next round won't be automatically started after ice destruction on Erosion or the eye closing on Polyphemus
- Wiki links now go to the community Bloons wiki and not the fandom one

## Rogue Legends

- The reward popup after choosing a boost now goes away faster based on your fast forward speed
- Added hotkeys for choosing rewards (default 1,2,3,4,5), re-rolling rewards (default Tab), and selecting your reward choice (default Space, or pressing num again)
- You can reorder your towers in the My Party screen by selecting them and using the arrow keys
- Hotkey Display now works for Rogue Shop Icons, and if you have multiple of the same monkey pressing its hotkey repeatedly cycles through the options for it rather than only ever doing the first one
