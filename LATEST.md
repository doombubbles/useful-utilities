- Added a new Upgrade Queueing feature
  - If you attempt to purchase an Upgrade when you don't have the cash for it, it will be queued to automatically purchase once you do
    - A list of currently queued upgrades is visible in the top left by the Cash display
    - Additionally, in the tower selection menu, the upgrade pips will be labeled with their position in queue
    - Clicking on the visual indicators in either place will cancel that queued upgrade
    - You can also queue an upgrade even if you do have the cash already by holding Shift while performing the upgrade
  - If you try to Paste a tower when you don't have enough money, you'll now be able to place the base tower and have the upgrades be queued
