- Fixed for BTD6 v49
- Removed the Rogue Legends tower hotkey cycling, as Ninja Kiwi added it themselves
- Ninja Kiwi added their own version of tower placement snapping in the accessbility options, but Auto Nudge will not
be removed as it can still be useful for finding a very tiny mearby placement spot
